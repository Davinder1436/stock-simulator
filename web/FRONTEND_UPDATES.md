## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### New Components
- `components/ChapterSelection.tsx` - Chapter selection screen
- `components/TeachingTipPopup.tsx` - Auto-popup teaching tips
- `components/CandlestickChart.tsx` - Professional candlestick chart

### Updated Files
- `types/simulation.ts` - Added new interfaces
- `context/SimulationContext.tsx` - Chapter loading, tip management
- `app/page.tsx` - Chapter selection integration, tip rendering
- `components/MarketView.tsx` - Candlestick chart integration
- `app/globals.css` - New animations
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Animation definitions

### Data Files (Copied to public/)
- `chapter1-data.json` - Easy difficulty (existing)
- `chapter6-data.json` - Medium difficulty (new)
- `chapter11-data.json` - Hard difficulty (new)

## 🚀 How It Works

### Chapter Selection Flow
1. User sees chapter selection screen on first load
2. Clicks on a chapter card
3. Data loads via `loadChapter(chapter)`
4. Simulation screen appears with loaded data

### Teaching Tips Flow
1. Simulation runs with timer
2. Every second, check if timestamp matches a teaching tip
3. If match found and not shown before, display popup
4. Auto-dismiss after `duration_seconds`
5. User can manually dismiss with "Got it!" button
6. Tips tracked in `shownTips` Set to prevent re-showing

### Candlestick Chart
1. Groups price points into candlesticks (max 50 candles)
2. Calculates OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) for each group
3. Renders wicks (high-low lines) and bodies (open-close rects)
4. Green if close >= open, red otherwise
5. Highlights special patterns with colored borders and indicators

## 🎨 Pattern Recognition

The candlestick chart automatically highlights these patterns:
- **Doji** - Yellow border (indecision)
- **Hammer** - Green border (bullish reversal)
- **Shooting Star** - Red border (bearish reversal)
- **Marubozu** - Purple border (strong momentum)
- **Engulfing Bull** - Bright green (powerful bullish)
- **Engulfing Bear** - Bright red (powerful bearish)
- **Spinning Top** - Indigo border (consolidation)

## 📊 Teaching Tip Categories

Each category has a unique color and icon:
- **Candle Pattern** - Blue (Activity icon)
- **Chart Pattern** - Purple (TrendingUp icon)
- **Indicator** - Green (BarChart2 icon)
- **Risk Management** - Yellow (AlertTriangle icon)
