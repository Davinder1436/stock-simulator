          "Makes you rich faster"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Diversification reduces portfolio risk by spreading investments across uncorrelated assets. When one falls, others may rise or stay stable, reducing overall volatility."

        "id": 2,
        "question": "What does negative correlation between assets mean?",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Negative correlation means assets move in opposite directions. Gold and equity often have negative correlation - when stocks fall, gold rises as a safe haven."

          "Never - let winners run",
          "Annually or when allocation drifts 5-10% from target",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Rebalance annually or when your allocation drifts significantly (5-10%) from targets. This locks in profits from winners and buys underperformers at lower prices."

          "To avoid all taxes"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Gold acts as a hedge against inflation and equity volatility. It tends to rise when stocks fall (negative correlation), protecting your portfolio during corrections."
